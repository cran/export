# export TODO #

- In graph2bitmap : add GIF support, maybe also BMP?
  (see png::readPNG(), caTools::write.gif())

- In graph2pdf : maybe also support append option, to append to existing file, maybe using
plotflow:::mergePDF
https://github.com/trinker/plotflow but requires Ghostscript

- in ggplot2 plots: maybe change font & point sizes together with size of figure:
  geom_point(size=1.5) +  # default is 2
  theme_grey(base_size=10)  # default is 12

- also allow for 16:9 or 4:3 Powerpoint templates

- ftable is not well implements and is exported in inconvenient way (long table...)

- Currently,  rvg::dml_docx uses dml_docx() which is deprecated. Advised to use devEMF::emf instead, maybe implemented in the next update of "rvg"?
